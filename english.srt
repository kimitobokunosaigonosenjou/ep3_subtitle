1
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,120
Captain Mismis.

2
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,830
Huh?

3
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:23,790
Here, I bought you the soda pop
you like so much.

4
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:26,870
Yay! Ginger ale!

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,160
Here you go, Nene and Jhin.

6
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,540
Let's take a little break.

7
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:34,160
Well, isn't this a treat? Not canned,
but bottled drinks?

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,240
Huh?

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:41,490
Oh, I didn't even think about it.

10
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,290
Hey-yo!

11
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,200
Mismis, where are you at?

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,290
Risya?

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:48,700
How's it going?

14
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:52,370
You're not whining about the many
materials to memorize, are you?

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,450
Uh...

16
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:56,490
Anyway, Issy.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,290
Would you mind coming over?

18
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:01,290
To your place, Risya?

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,990
Nope. To Imperial Senate.

20
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:29,660
Our Last Crusade or the Rise of a New World

21
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:41,060
Encounter

22
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,080
So, Successor of the Black Steel.

23
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,060
Successor of the Black Steel
and the Ice Calamity Witch

24
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,200
We reviewed your report.

25
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,290
You fought against the Ice Calamity Witch
and held her off.

26
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,080
You truly are a gem.

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,790
But I failed to protect the reactor.

28
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,910
The mission we gave you was
to stop the Ice Calamity Witch.

29
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,330
Not to protect the reactor.

30
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:02,120
The Empire has the fighting power
to go against the Ice Calamity Witch.

31
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,910
That knowledge alone is a
remarkable military achievement.

32
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,200
So much so that the reinstation
as a Saint Disciple is up in the air.

33
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,540
Saint Disciple...

34
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,540
We also understand your determination
towards attaining peace.

35
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,620
As a Saint Disciple, you could gain
an audience with His Excellency.

36
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:25,450
However, you are a well-known
criminal within the Empire.

37
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:28,330
Therefore, we are offering you a new condition.

38
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:32,540
Apprehend the Ice Calamity Witch.

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,240
We are counting on you.

40
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:47,450
Why do you like this artist?

41
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:50,660
So how old are you, anyway?

42
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,370
Then I'm older than you.

43
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,120
You want to skip tomorrow's training session?

44
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,910
Are you not feeling well?

45
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,740
I have something to do in Neutral city.

46
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:10,370
Huh? But you just went to the art exhibition
with Risya's ticket, right?

47
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,660
I'm not going there to see something.

48
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,240
There's somebody I'd like to speak to.

49
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,660
And that's why you want to skip the training.

50
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,240
Yes. Could you do that?

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,830
I guess I can't say no if you
feel that strongly about it.

52
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:26,990
Thank you.

53
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,410
Under one condition...
I'm going with you tomorrow.

54
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,830
What?

55
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,200
Look at the window.

56
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,240
I bet you looked strained right now.

57
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:43,700
See? I can't let a team member
in that condition go alone.

58
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,450
Not in good conscious, as a captain.

59
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:51,620
I understand. Then please come with me.

60
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,330
Of course!

61
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:12,950
Don't get the wrong idea.

62
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,410
This is to repay you for showing me
the way to the museum.

63
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,330
That's all it is.

64
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,620
Lady Alice.

65
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,160
I have the dossier on that Imperial swordsman.

66
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,790
Who is he?

67
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,910
A Saint Disciple.

68
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,200
Saint Disciple?!

69
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:37,160
He was apparently the youngest
in history to be promoted.

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,410
No doubt he's one of the most talented
swordsmen the Empire has ever had.

71
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,950
Then how could I have not known?

72
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,830
There's a reason for that.

73
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,700
After his promotion,
he hasn't set foot on a battlefield.

74
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,910
His promotion was retracted
and then he was imprisoned.

75
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,620
The reason?

76
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:04,950
Apparently, he freed an astral mage
imprisoned by the Empire.

77
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,580
I don't understand.

78
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,290
In the Nelka forest, Iska was after me.

79
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,660
So why...?

80
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:19,870
Rin, find out who this astral mage
was that he freed.

81
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm already on it. I'll need few more days.

82
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:37,990
It seems you have a strong interest
in this enemy soldier.

83
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,450
Mother!

84
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,290
The Empire is our enemy.

85
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:51,240
A nation full of people who hate
and persecute us, calling us witches...

86
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:58,370
The way we were treated by the Empire was
nothing short of a cruel witch hunt.

87
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,450
Countless astral mages fell victim to them.

88
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:09,450
To defeat and overthrow the Empire
is us astral mages' dearest wish.

89
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,990
The Imperial artists are no exception.

90
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,950
You know about the numerous paintings
of the "witch hunt" and "witch trials."

91
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:19,660
They, too, are pawns of the Empire.

92
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,080
It is inexcusable to collect things like these.

93
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,200
Yes, Mother.

94
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:28,330
That is all I wanted to say.

95
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,330
I have taken enough of your time
so late at night.

96
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,330
Rin, are you around?

97
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:46,540
Yes.

98
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,450
What did Her Majesty say?

99
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,450
Lady Alice?

100
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:58,160
Be prepared to take me
to Neutral city first thing tomorrow.

101
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,700
Again?! But if we bump
into that soldier, Iska, again--

102
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,540
That's what I'm counting on.

103
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:09,040
I want to figure out his true intent for myself.

104
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,830
So, Iska. Care to tell me who it is
you've arranged this meeting with?

105
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't have an arrangement.

106
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,620
What do you mean?

107
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:23,490
I have a feeling she'll come.

108
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:27,830
I've never believed in fate
or destiny until now, but...

109
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:30,990
I have a feeling we'll meet again.

110
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,540
Why do you want to meet her?

111
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,700
There's something that I want to make sure of.

112
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:41,540
Oh, how rare! It's an albatross!

113
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,580
Not many live in the Empire territory anymore.

114
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,330
Though, I think a few villages
in the outskirts tame them.

115
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:55,450
Captain, please keep going until the entrance,
and then stop the car.

116
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,950
O-Okay...

117
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,540
We really do have a connection.

118
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,080
I wonder, what kind of a star
we were born under?

119
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,410
Who's the girl?

120
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:24,410
My boss, Captain Mismis.

121
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:28,040
I see. So that's why you came.

122
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,080
Um, Iska... Who's the pretty girl?

123
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,840
She's--

124
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,330
It's fine. I'll introduce myself.

125
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:39,080
Hello, captain from the Empire.

126
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,160
My name is Alice.

127
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,830
Aliceliese Lou Nebulis IX.

128
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:47,790
Miss Alice? But, wait, "Nebulis"?

129
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,290
Perhaps the people of the Empire may
know me better as the Ice Calamity Witch.

130
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,120
Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What's going on?!

131
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:01,660
Let's go outside. Follow me.

132
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:09,080
I wonder why we hate each other
when there are peaceful cities like this?

133
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,410
I have a question for you.

134
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:18,080
A year ago, an Imperial soldier
was arrested for treason.

135
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:23,950
A peculiar Saint Disciple who freed
an astral mage taken captive by the Empire.

136
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,910
That was you.

137
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,790
Yes.

138
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,080
Why did you do that?

139
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,700
She was just a little girl.

140
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,240
Twelve or 13 years old, with weak astral power.

141
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,790
But the Empire wishes to apprehend
all astral mages regardless of that.

142
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,410
I didn't like it.

143
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,120
Your actions are contradicting.

144
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:50,910
You came after me in
the Nelka forest to capture me.

145
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:56,580
But a year ago, you freed someone because
you pitied her? That's not convincing.

146
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,330
Lost your voice? What's wrong, Imperial soldier?

147
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,540
They aren't contradicting.

148
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,700
What?

149
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:08,370
My goal hasn't changed.
Not now, and not a year ago.

150
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,040
Your goal?

151
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,330
A peace negotiation.

152
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,160
I want to end the war.

153
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,120
But the Empire won't act
based on anything I say.

154
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,950
Neither will the Nebulis Sovereignty.

155
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,410
Of course not.

156
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:28,620
So my plan was to take a direct
descendant of Nebulis hostage.

157
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,370
A powerful astral mage, or purebred,
as the Empire calls them.

158
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:38,080
I figured if royalty was in danger,
it would faze the Nebulis Sovereignty.

159
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,910
Their people will also be concerned.

160
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:45,370
It would force them to respond
to the peace negotiation.

161
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:48,540
I don't think you're lying.

162
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,410
But that won't work. Nothing will change.

163
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:53,490
Why not?

164
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:57,790
Even if you take me hostage,
Mother will not react.

165
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,410
So there won't be a negotiation.

166
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:05,410
Peace is just a pipe dream. You've never
been to the Sovereignty, have you?

167
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:10,910
You have no idea how many people
in our nation loath the Empire.

168
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:18,870
But I also never knew the Empire
had people like you.

169
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:21,950
Among the barbaric and
coercive Imperial soldiers,

170
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:26,410
I never knew there was someone
who wants to fight for the end of this war.

171
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:31,910
Besides... I think I got
to know you pretty well.

172
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:36,370
You should serve under me.

173
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,870
Huh?!

174
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,910
W-W-Wait, Lady Alice!

175
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:43,990
Wh-Wh-Wh-What are you saying?!

176
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,370
This is not what we discussed
at yesterday's meeting!

177
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,910
It just came to me.

178
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,040
This is insane!

179
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,950
Neither Lady Elletear or Lady Sisbell
will allow that, let alone Her Majesty!

180
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,200
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

181
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,740
I'll guarantee your social status.
You will defect from the Empire.

182
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,740
I-Iska...

183
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,490
What?

184
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,080
Rin, what's happening?

185
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,990
I don't know, but my astral power
is frightened as well.

186
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,540
The sky...?

187
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:28,120
Captain Mismis, fall back!

188
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:42,370
Astral sword... Treacherous...
blade... of the star.

189
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,040
The... Founder?

190
00:13:47,370 --> 00:13:51,370
I-Iska? Did she just say the Founder?

191
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:54,370
I think it's exactly what you're thinking,
Captain Mismis.

192
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,830
The Grand Witch Nebulis is alive.

193
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,990
A hundred years ago, when she turned
the Empire into a sea of flames.

194
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,290
This isn't fair! It's just me
and Iska on our side!

195
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,450
W-Wait, I didn't do anything!

196
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,830
The Empire... Those who corrode
this planet and its astral power...

197
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:18,120
They should all perish!

198
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,290
Mow them down.

199
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:36,830
Every astral power
in the Sovereignty is resonating...

200
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,490
What is happening?

201
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,580
The Founder's bond...!

202
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,790
But this is a dream come true.

203
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:55,370
With her power, the Empire's defeat
is within arm's reach.

204
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,990
Captain...?

205
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,120
Captain!

206
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,580
Isn't the Founder your ally?

207
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:19,200
The people of Nebulis call her the Founder
because she created our nation.

208
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:23,080
To call her an ally would be sheer arrogance!

209
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:27,240
So then, why would the Founder go
after Alice, her own descendant?

210
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:31,080
It's the astral power's auto defense system.

211
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,200
Though, I don't know what it's reacting to.

212
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,490
L-Lady Alice!

213
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:35,990
How frustrating...

214
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:37,870
Frustrating?

215
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:43,040
I wanted to settle this
just between the two of us.

216
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,910
Ever since I met you in the Neutral city,
I've had this feeling inside me...

217
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,540
But as a princess, that's not allowed.

218
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,450
So I came here today to quash it.

219
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:57,950
I was really fired up about it, too.

220
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:03,200
I wanted just the two of us to settle this,
without anyone's meddling.

221
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,370
And of all people, the stupid Founder
waltzes in between us and ruins it!

222
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,950
S-Stupid?!

223
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,580
Wha...?

224
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,580
Captain!

225
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,410
Anyway, we won't get anywhere
if we just stand here. Let's go!

226
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:21,990
Please stop this, Founder!

227
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:26,120
An astral mage dares to get in my way?

228
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,660
If you are joining forces with the Empire...

229
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,540
Oh, no!

230
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,950
Then vanish off the face of this planet.

231
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,740
Rin!

232
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,450
Rin! Rin!

233
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,240
Answer me!

234
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:57,660
Rin, please open your eyes...

235
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,330
Alice, calm down.

236
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:04,040
Cool Rin's body with ice.
That's what your astral power is for.

237
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,370
Oh...

238
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:12,120
Captain Mismis, please take her to the hospital.

239
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:15,450
Preferably to an astral injury specialist.

240
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,540
Huh? B-But...

241
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,700
And also order the residents
to evacuate the area.

242
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,330
This field is about to become
a very dangerous area.

243
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:25,870
A-All right!

244
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,580
I'm sorry.

245
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,870
Don't be.

246
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:41,660
Are those the swords that have awakened me?

247
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:44,120
Those are Crossweil's swords.

248
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:47,580
Crossweil?! How do you know Master?

249
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,660
You're his...?

250
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:55,120
No matter. You cannot possibly stop me.

251
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,080
An astral mage taking sides with the Empire...

252
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,740
No amount of screaming
will save you from your sin.

253
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:25,240
You're also an astral mage, but you've hurt
an ally without so much as a blink.

254
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,740
You're not the hero of the Sovereignty anymore!

255
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,700
A Hero? You cannot save the world
with such a pretty word.

256
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,120
That is why I will become a witch
and destroy the Empire.

257
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:44,950
Nebulis, you may have been the hope
that lead all astral mages 100 years ago.

258
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,830
But, no...

259
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:49,450
Seeing your actions made me understand...

260
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:51,080
Right now, in this age...

261
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,580
You are no longer needed!

262
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:57,120
Imperial soldier. Astral mage. You two--

263
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,290
Shut up!

264
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,160
Your actions are hollow and meaningless.

265
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,950
The future I strive for is not with you.

266
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:06,330
Neither is the world I strive for.

267
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:11,580
So go back to sleep for another hundred years!

268
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,200
The Empire's lap dog...

269
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,950
You have no idea how many astral mages
were oppressed by the likes of you.

270
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:21,950
Watch out!

271
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:23,370
Die.

272
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,450
She uses both ice and earth astral powers?!

273
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,660
Jump up!

274
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,990
Great Ice Calamity.

275
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,490
Feel the planet's wrath.

276
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:05,950
Let go of your hand! You'll--

277
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,740
Don't you think we're feeling the same way?

278
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,120
Alice, you're upset because Rin was hurt.

279
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,790
And a peace negotiation is out
the window with her rampage.

280
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:24,790
This is neither the Empire nor the Sovereignty.
We're in Neutral city.

281
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:28,830
We share the same goal.
That's all that matters. So...

282
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,740
Can I really trust someone from the Empire...?

283
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:40,660
Ice Calamity: Flooding Snow Lights!

284
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,080
Shoot up, Star of Ice!

285
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,160
I'm not done yet!

286
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,490
So aves cal pile.

287
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:14,120
Crawl the earth like the pathetic dog you are.

288
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:21,040
Keep running!

289
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,870
I'm coming for you!

290
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:31,040
Insolence. You have no idea
the quarrel I have with the Empire.

291
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:36,290
It's because of your vendetta
that this ridiculous war won't end!

292
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,660
Silence!

293
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,490
Alice!

294
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:43,910
Bloom forth!

295
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,490
It cannot be!

296
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,120
Go back to sleep, Nebulis!

297
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:07,450
The next time you awake, the world
will be a slightly better place.

298
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:28,370
Alice, about what you said earlier...

299
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,910
Huh?

300
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,910
I can't flip to the Nebulis' side.

301
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,790
I see.

302
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:39,450
Then you and I are enemies after all.

303
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:45,290
But I'd like to propose one thing.

304
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,660
Okay.

305
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,870
A temporary truce... I'm spent for today.

306
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,620
No objections here.

307
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,200
Just for today, though.

308
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,700
I know.

309
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,120
Tomorrow, we're back to being enemies.

310
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,700
All right.
